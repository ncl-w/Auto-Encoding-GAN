## 4.2. Experiments on Synthetic Datasets
Since the data and network size is relatively small for this section, I decided to run it locally. This project was originally designed for **Intel-based Windows/Linux machines** with **CUDA acceleration**. Since I am using a **MacBook Air (M3, 2024)**, I made the following key modifications:  

1. **Switched from CUDA to Metal (MPS)** ‚Äì CUDA is not available on Apple Silicon, so I replaced CUDA-related operations with `torch.backends.mps`.  
2. **Adjusted DataLoader Parameters** ‚Äì Reduced `num_workers` in `DataLoader` to improve compatibility with macOS.  
3. **Handled BatchNorm Compatibility** ‚Äì Modified some `BatchNorm` operations to prevent issues with PyTorch MPS.  
4. **Ensured Proper Package Installation** ‚Äì Installed `torch`, `torchvision`, and `torchaudio` using the **MPS backend**, and fixed package conflicts.
